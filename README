This is an NSX-v API library so that people can consume NSX-v API using Python easily. The intention
is to free someone who writes a code from directly manipulating the XML.

Currently the number of supported API calls is pretty limited but I am going to add more as needed
basis. It is relatively straingtforward to add API call support, your contrbibution is very much
welcome.
