This is an NSX-v API library so that people can consume NSX-v API using Pythong easily. The 
intention is to free someone who writes a code from the neccesity of manipulating XML 
expliclty.

Currently the number of supported API calls is pretty limited but I am going to add more as
needed basis. It is relatively straingtforward to add API call, your contrbibution is very 
much welcome.
